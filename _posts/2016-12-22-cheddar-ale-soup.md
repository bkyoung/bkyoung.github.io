Serves 6-8

### Ingredients
  * 3 tablespoons salted butter
  * 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  * 1/4 cup minced yellow onion
  * 1/4 cup small diced red bell pepper
  * 1/4 cup small diced green bell pepper
  * 2 garlic cloves, minced
  * 1 cup Free State Ad Astra ale
  * 3 ounces cream cheese
  * 3 cups cream
  * 2 teaspoons salt
  * 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
  * 1 teaspoon hot sauce
  * Fresh parsley and thyme to taste
  * 6 ounces grated Alma white or yellow cheddar cheese


### Preparation
  * Peel and dice onion and garlic
  * Dice bell pepper
  * Grate cheese

### Instructions
In 1 tablespoon butter, cook onion, peppers and garlic until onion is transparent. Add remaining butter and flour, stir well and cook mixture on medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add beer in small increments, mixing smooth after each addition. Cut cream cheese into smaller chunks and add to mixture. Mash and stir cream cheese until it is completely melted into mixture. Gradually add cream to mixture, mixing smooth after each addition. You may want to use a whisk at this point. Add seasonings, stir and heat to 160 degrees, being careful not to heat beyond this temperature. Add cheese in three increments stirring smooth with a whisk after each addition. If cheese is not melting after 30 seconds, check temperature and add heat if necessary. If soup is thin, add more cheese. If soup is thick, add milk.
