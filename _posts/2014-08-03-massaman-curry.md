This is a Thai style curry with chicken and potatoes and other ingredients that don't sound like they should go together, but make an amazing combination. I had a friend at work try it before I'd tell him what was in it. He liked it, but agreed that he might not have tried it if I'd told him what's in it beforehand. Nothing disgusting, just not a combination of ingredients I'd normally think "hmm, I bet that goes well together."

As usual, we'd like to note that using fresh ingredients makes a big difference in the outcome of the recipe.  In particular, in this case, the peanut butter.  We've used Skippy, Skippy All Natural, Smucker's All Natural, and real peanut butter we watched them make at the Merc.  The more "all natural" you can get the better.
