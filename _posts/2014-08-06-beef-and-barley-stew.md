This recipe brings back childhood memories of one autumn evening when we had this meal for dinner.  It was late autumn, and I had been outside playing with a friend from school all afternoon, and the sun was setting earlier in the evening.  It was chilly and the smell of autumn was in the air.  I love that time of year, and I love this recipe.  It's very hearty and tasty.
